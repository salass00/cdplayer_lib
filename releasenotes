cdplayer.library 52.1 (16.11.2011)

- First released version.

cdplayer.library 52.2 (24.11.2011)

- Rewrote the code so that CDDA decoding (only endian conversion) and volume
  scaling are now done in one pass instead of two.

- Rewrote CDDA buffering code so that it reads in advance (should work better
  with real CD/DVD drives than it did before).

- Track numbers in API are now always 1 to NumTracks (the example code gave
  the impression that in CDPlay at least they are numbered 0 to NumTracks - 1
  but this appears to be false from testing with other programs).

cdplayer.library 52.3 (25-Nov-2011)

- Fixed a stupid bug in the CDDA buffering which would cause stuttering audio
  playback especially at the beginning.

cdplayer.library 52.4 (28-Nov-2011)

- Fixed INQUIRY command in CDInfo().

- Changed GetVolume() and SetVolume() implementations so that they return
  quicker than before.

cdplayer.library 52.5 (30-Nov-2011)

- Increased the size of the CDDA buffers to get more reliable CDDA playback
  with real CD/DVD drives.

- Changed around the volume setting/getting code so that it now reads/writes
  all channels in one go and doesn't require any additional locking.

cdplayer.library 52.6 (23-Dec-2011)

- Added CDPlayAddr() function.

cdplayer.library 52.7 (23-Jul-2012)

- CDPLAY_PAUSE now flushes the CDDA buffers so that there won't be any wrong
  CDDA frames played if a program chooses to resume playback at a different
  position than the paused one.
