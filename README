This is an AmigaOS 4.x rewrite of the V37 cdplayer.library:

http://aminet.net/package/dev/misc/CDPlayerlib37

Rather than letting the CD/DVD drive handle the playback, which doesn't work
with many newer drives, this version reads the CDDA data directly using the
SCSI READ CD command and plays it back through AHI.

Installation:

Copy cdplayer.library LIBS:

Source code:

The source code for current and older versions is available on github:
